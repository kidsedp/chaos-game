## What is the Chaos Game?
The Chaos Game ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game)) is a method for creating ordered shapes out of randomness. It follows a simple series of instructions, which can be summarized as follows:

1. Pick *n* corner points at random.
2. Pick a starting point *p* at random.
3. Each turn, randomly choose one of the corner points and move some percentage of the way *d* toward that point. (Let's say halfway.) Let *p* be equal to this new location.
4. Draw a dot at *p*.
5. Go back to step 3; repeat forever.
